CanIUse Extension
=================

Welcome to the initial release of the CanIUse Brackets extension. This extension
wraps the remote data for caniuse.com, a site that provides capability stats for 
various web features amongst the top browsers. Currently this extension shows a
subset of available browsers I think were most important, but this list could be 
changed as well.

To install, simply drag the brackets-caniuse folder to your Brackets/Edge Code 
extensions/user folder, reload your editor, and select "Show CanIUse" from the
View menu.
